Under-utilizing intellectual ability could lead to mental anguish and stress , a statement that fell on deaf ears when I first heard it but not long ago it finally started to make sense. 

I am an Engineer by training and worked in the oil field after graduating  back in 2012. I loved my job and all was well until the oil prices plummeted down to levels not seen in decades and had to move on to a sales job. Initially I liked the job but within a year realized the monotonous behaviour of the job and also the uneasiness and fatigue  at the end of days work. Switched to another job in the life, health and auto insurance industry but got hammered with the same exact situation. It was not the money as sales job we all know pay handsome amount of money and basically it all depends on your ability to convince people about product which a high school graduate with a sweet mouth piece can also perform quiet easily. 

I had to figure out what was going on with me. Is it that I am not the best sales person out there thats stressing me out or is it the fact that I am just blaming myself subconsciously for under-utilizing my ability. I felt like its an addiction just like how we all get used to going to the gym and feel horrible the day we miss the gym day. The body does not feel right and the sleep is a mess. Why is that ? Only because we have gotten used to the physical exertion on a day to day basis and if not expressed in the right way makes the body still deprived of that feeling of accomplishment. 

The faculty of mind needs to be expressed in the same way once it is used to working long hours crunching numbers , memorizing formulaes and developing concepts in order to apply them in a useful manner. Just like how we physically express ourself in the gym we have to focus on our mental activity on a daily basis to keep the hormones in balance.
Just like running an 8-minute mile realease endorphines in your body and calms you down with the analgesic effect , reading a book for couple of hours also releases dopamines and make you feel accomplished and satisfied. 

To jump start my brain I decided to work on the pre-boot camp offered free of charge by Flatiron and was surprised by the effect it had on my mood . As I made progress through the lessons and associated labs I fet accomplished and the mental activity helped me had an amazing day and a soothing sleep at night. 

I had taken a few courses in programming  at the undergraduate level and was an average student back then when it came to coding. The way Flatiron have put together the syllabus and the labs now I have better understanding of the concepts and also a more pragmatic approach to problem solving. Problem solving and the sense of accomplishment after completing each lab seems a very small thing in the bigger scheme of things but I think it is the game changer and if one keeps putting in the time day in and day out one  can definitely put themselves in a better postition considering the growth in the web development market. 

Happy coding!
